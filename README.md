# CLI-GUI-Interface
This is a python script that interacts with the any exe with a cli, in theroy, in an attempt to avoid having to type out commands. This is in very early stages, and I just made it as a port of my Rclone GUI, I will soon change how everything works with both of them, so that this is used as a submodule. This is not made for public use, I'm just making it as a fun side project and to help increase my coding experience.
